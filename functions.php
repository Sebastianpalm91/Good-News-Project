                          and then Jesus would have to explain how he was resurrected, and how it was a miracle, and the dude\'d be like "Uhh okay, whatever you say, bro..." And he\'s not gonna come back on a Saturday. Everybody\'s busy,
                          doing chores, workin\' the loom, trimmin\' the beard, NO. He waited the perfect number of days, three.
                          Plus it\'s Sunday, so everyone\'s in church already, and they\'re all in there like "Oh no, Jesus is dead",
                          and then BAM! He bursts in the back door, runnin\' up the aisle, everyone\'s totally psyched, and FYI, that\'s when he invented the high five.
                          That\'s why we wait three days to call a woman, because that\'s how long Jesus wants us to wait.... True story.',
