                          and then Jesus would have to explain how he was resurrected, and how it was a miracle, and the dude\'d be like "Uhh okay, whatever you say, bro..." And he\'s not gonna come back on a Saturday. Everybody\'s busy,
                          doing chores, workin\' the loom, trimmin\' the beard, NO. He waited the perfect number of days, three.
